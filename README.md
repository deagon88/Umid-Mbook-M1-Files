# Umid-Mbook-M1-Files

Welcome to my little backup/project repository for the Umid Mbook M1 Netbook, also known/re-released as Sagemcom Spiga (turkey) or the Onkyo BX407A4 (japan.) 

In here you’ll find the latest known versions of windows drivers, the umid/sagemcom launcher app, a few old fully working Linux Roms, some readmes/tweaks and general ‘stuff’ from my own time messing around on these systems. Everything in this repository should work equally as well with all three Netbooks/UMPCs.

My goal here was to simply just put everything for these devices in one single place, I claim no ownership to any of the old software and files created by other people. If you do happen to own anything in here I’ve uploaded and want it removed, please send me a message & I’ll be happy to do so.

As for files in this repository I've created myself, I’m generally not bothered what people do with it. Just be a good bro and give namedrop & some links back 'upstream' to here in a readme somewhere ;)

This keyboard layout's for the Sagemcom Spiga netbook, it fixes the lowercase I key for english users. I switched i & i-dotless around with each other on the Turkish Q keyboard layout and made sure every other key matched the spigas keyboard labels.

How to use - install run setup.exe or the appropriate msi file and select the new turkish Q keyboard layout from windows regional settings in the control panel. These layout files should work on Windows 2k/xp, Vista and Windows 7.

To use the red symbols (>Â£#<|, etc), press and hold blue House key (left of space) + the key you want. All other blue labelled Keys need you to hold Fn.
